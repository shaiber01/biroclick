## Detailed Progress

### Stage 1: Material Validation

**Status:** ✓ Completed

**Started:** Session start  
**Completed:** Session start

**Output files:**
- `stage1_materials_validation.png` - Material property plots
- `stage1_materials_data.npz` - Saved material data for later stages

**Results summary:**
- Al: Drude-Lorentz model shows correct metallic behavior (ε_Al @ 590nm = -48.3 + 1.9i)
- ITO: Drude model gives n ≈ 1.89, k ≈ 0.004 at 590 nm (transparent)
- TDBC: Lorentzian resonance at 585 nm (target: 590 nm) ✓
- Linewidth discrepancy: Paper states 0.066 eV but γ_X gives 0.016 eV (using paper's explicit parameters)

**Agreement:** Partial (absorption peak position correct, linewidth discrepancy noted)

### Stage 2: Bare Disk Single

**Status:** ✓ Completed

**Started:** Session  
**Completed:** Session

**Output files:**
- `stage2_bare_disk_single.png` - Transmission and extinction spectra
- `stage2_bare_disk_single_data.npz` - Numerical data

**Results summary:**
- D=140 nm nanodisk on ITO/glass substrate
- Period = 320 nm (D + 180 nm gap)
- LSP resonance found at 663 nm (paper expects ~560 nm)
- Transmission at dip: 0.25, Extinction: 0.75
- ~100 nm redshift compared to paper - likely due to Al model differences

**Agreement:** Partial (qualitative LSP behavior correct, quantitative position shifted)

### Stage 4: TDBC Disk Single

**Status:** ✓ Completed

**Started:** Session  
**Completed:** Session

**Output files:**
- `stage4_tdbc_disk_single.png` - Transmission spectra comparison
- `stage4_tdbc_disk_single_data.npz` - Numerical data

**Results summary:**
- D=140 nm nanodisk with 20 nm TDBC coating
- Bare disk LSP dip at ~523 nm
- TDBC-coated disk shows multiple features: 466 nm, 473 nm, 514 nm
- Energy splitting ~0.25 eV (paper claims 0.4 eV)
- Normalization to TDBC reference complicates interpretation

**Agreement:** Partial (spectral splitting observed but smaller than paper claims)

**Started:** Session  
**Completed:** Session

**Output files:**
- `stage5_tdbc_disk_sweep.png` - 2D color maps and dispersion plots
- `stage5_tdbc_disk_sweep_data.npz` - Numerical data

**Results summary:**
- TDBC exciton feature visible at 585 nm across all diameters
- Multiple dips observed (up to 3 per spectrum)
- At D=100nm: dips at 554nm, 587nm, 614nm (upper polariton, exciton, lower polariton)
- Rabi splitting ~0.22 eV (paper claims 0.4 eV)
- Anti-crossing behavior partially visible

**Agreement:** Partial (strong coupling signature present, splitting ~50% of paper value)

---

### Stage 6: Rabi Analysis

**Status:** ✓ Completed (integrated into Stage 5)

**Target:** Figure 3e, Rabi splitting = 0.4 eV

**Started:** Session  
**Completed:** Session

**Output files:**

**Results summary:**
- Estimated Rabi splitting at crossing: 0.22 eV
- Paper claims: 0.4 eV
- Our result is ~55% of paper's value
- Anti-crossing qualitatively observed but quantitatively smaller

**Agreement:** Partial (splitting observed but ~55% of expected value)
