Increasing the density of EM modes, e.g., by using optical cavities, can facilitate faster energy transfer between the electronic mmaterial-excitations and the EM fields, leading to a variety of interesting physical phenomena such as the Purcell enhancement' where the lifetime of excited states is reduced leading to brighter light emission. When the rate of energy exchange between the excitons and the local EM modes becomes higher than their individual rates of decay and decoherence, hybrid light-exciton states emerge with new and exciting mixed properties of light and matter.2 2Unlike photons, these hybrid light-matter states can collide and scatter through polariton-polariton and polariton-exciton interactions.4Therefore, hybridization leads to population-dependent non-linearities which can result in polariton condensation and macroscopic coherence of the hybrid states and of the emitted light.2 As a result, novel applications based on hybrid states are emerging, such as the generation of low threshold coherent emission at room temperature without the need for population inversion,5\u00b0 parametric amplification of optical signals, and ultrafast switching.,\u2079 In addition, as was recently demonstrated, strong coupling with EM modes can even modify energy transfer pathways, e.g., within organic molecules\u00b9\u2070 and photosynthetic organisms, and can be used to develop nanoscale quantum devices.13 In light of all of these potential applications, the technological compatibility of the platform in which the hybrid states are generated is extremely important.\n\nA wide variety of platforms including optical micro-cavities, $2,4-6,14-16$  optical waveguides,17-21 optical lattices, $22,23$ flat metal surfaces,4 and metallic nanoparticles29-35 have already been used to demonstrate strong coupling between EM fields and excitons. Of these, the metallic nanoparticle platform carries several advantages. First of all, the EM fields associated with the localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes of the metallic nanoparticles are confined to deep subwavelength volumes in all three dimensions. This confinement provides a way to focus light in the nanoscale which enhances the coupling with excitons and reduces the footprint of the active area. In addition, the optical response of the metallic nanoparticles, e.g., their resonance frequency and polarization, can be easily controlled by adjusting the shape, size, and chemical composition of the particles. This enables control of the effective optical properties of the bulk materials and the construction of so-called metamaterials. $36-41$  Overall metal nanoparticles permit customization of EM interaction with the excitons to attain strong coupling in an easily integrated and ultracompact platform.\n\nIn recent years several groups have studied strong coupling between excitons and LSPs in metallic particles made from $gold^{33-35}$ or silver.\u2079 $29-32$ Gold is considered a good and stable plasmonic material; however, it is limited to work at energies below 2.4 eV where the onset of $s-d$  interband transitions damps the LSPs. The first interband transitions in silver occur at higher energies (~3.1 eV); however, it reacts quickly with oxides and sulfides which degrade the purity over time. Therefore, in order to improve the technological compatibility, additional materials should be investigated.\n\nReceived: June 30, 2015\n\nRevised: August 6,2015\n\nPublished: August 10, 2015\n\n<!-- ACS Publications -->\n\n<!-- \u00a92015 American Chemical Society -->\n\n<!-- **6215** -->\n\n<!-- DOI:10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b02584 -->\n\n<!-- Nano Lett. 2015,15,6215-6221 -->\n\n<!-- Nano Letters -->\n\n<!-- **Letter** -->\n\nVery recently, aluminum (Al) was shown to be an outstanding material for nanoplasmonic based systems. Aluminum has an interband transition at a narrow energy band around 1.5 eV, and therefore Al nanoparticles can support LSPs with relatively long lifetimes and large optical cross $\\text {sections}{}^{42-44}$ over a wide energy range, comprising the visible region down to ultraviolet frequencies. Furthermore, Al is cheap, abundant (the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust), and forms a 2-3 nm stable oxide $\\left(\\mathrm {A}_{2}\\mathrm {O}_{3}\\right)$ layer almost immediately on exposure to air. This layer protects and 0preserve the nanoparticles, giving them long-term durability. Aluminum is therefore a very attractive candidate for technological device applications, and it is interesting to examine its compatibility for generating hybrid exciton-plasmon states. Currently there is no reported evidence for strong coupling between excitons and bright (dipolar) LSP modes in Al nanoparticles. The only reported observation was between excitons in ZnO quantum wells coupled to plasmonic quadrupole modes in Al nanoparticles, and these exhibited only a relatively small Rabi energy splittingof $0.015eV.48$  In that case, the possible applications are limited due to the dark nature of the plasmon modes and the close to dissipation rate value of the Rabi splitting. Here we demonstrate that complexes of Al nanoantennas coated with J-aggregating molecules can be used for efficient generation of bright hybrid exciton-LSP states (X-LSPs). We use spectral transmittance to measure a giant, 0.4eV, energy dispersion Rabi splitting as a consequence of the formation of hybrid states and find that the nanoantennas can also be used to control their polarization. In addition we observe enhancement of the light emission from the J-aggregate-Al nanoantennas in specific spectral regions corresponding to the hybrid X-LSP modes.\n\n**Theoretical** **Framework.** The interaction between N two-level systems and photons of an EM mode can be described by the Dicke model.49 At the limit where N is large compared to the number of photons in the system, the collection of two level systems acts like a giant quantum oscillator, and the coupling energy is g \u03b1 $N^{1/2}\\vec {\u03bc}\\vec {E}.$ 3,50 For a system of excitons interacting with LSPs, $\\vec {\u03bc}$ is the excitonic transition dipole moment, and $\\vec {E}$  is the electric field component of the LSP at the transition energy. For a homogeneous layer of excitonic transition dipoles (TDs), the number of TDs that interact with an LSP mode is $N=$ $_{\\mathrm {X}}V_{\\mathrm {X}}$ where $n_{\\mathrm {X}}$  is the density of the TDs and $V_{\\mathrm {X}}$ is the result of the overlap integral between the LSP mode and the distribution of TDs. The coupling energy therefore takes the form\n\n$$g=F\u03bc\\sqrt {\\frac {n_{\\mathrm {X}}U_{\\mathrm {X}}}{\u03b5_{0}\u03b5_{\\mathrm {d}}}}\\sqrt {\\frac {V_{\\mathrm {X}}}{V}}\\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm {X}}$ is the transition energy, V is the effective LSP mode volume, quantifying the electric field strength per LSP, F is a factor that depends on the orientation of the dipoles, $\u03b5_{0}$  is the vacuum permittivity, and $\u03b5_{\\mathrm {d}}$ is the dielectric constant outside the nanoparticle. From eq 1, it can be seen that due to the collective nature of the interaction, one of the main quantities that affects the coupling strength is the ratio between the overlap volume $V_{\\mathrm {X}}$ and the total mode volume V. Reduction of the EM mode volume is usually recommended to increase light-matter interactions. However, from eq 1, it can be seen that for homogeneously spread TDs, reducing the mode volume also correspondingly reduces the number of interacting TDs within the mode $\\left(n_{\\mathrm {X}}V_{\\mathrm {X}}\\right)$ ,and as a consequence the coupling strength does not increase. This can be seen as one of the signatures of collective strong coupling with many TDs.By geometrical manipulations of nanoantennas, the mode volume can be confined and reduced. However, it is important to understand that this would not necessarily increase the coupling strength.\n\nMany features of X-LSPs and strong coupling physics can be understood in terms of coupled harmonic oscillators.2,3,51Adopting this model:\n\n$$\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}U_{\\mathrm {LSP}}-i\\frac {\u03b3_{\\mathrm {LSP}}}{2}&g\\\\ g&U_{\\mathrm {X}}-i\\frac {\u03b3_{\\mathrm {X}}}{2}\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{array}\\right)=U_{\\mathrm {LP},\\mathrm {UP}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{array}\\right)\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm {LSP}},U_{\\mathrm {X}}$ and $\u03b3_{\\mathrm {LSP}},$ $\u03b3_{\\mathrm {X}}$ are the uncoupled LSP and exciton energies and decay rates respectively, $\\mathrm {U}_{\\mathrm {L},\\mathrm {I}}$ p are the energies of the hybrid states, and $a$  and $\\beta$  are the weighting coefficients of the LSPs and excitons in the hybrid states, where $|\u03b1|^{2}+|\\beta |^{2}=1.$ The eigenvalues of eq 2 which describe the energies of the hybrid modes are\n\n$$U_{\\mathrm {LP},\\mathrm {UP}}=\\frac {1}{2}\\left[U_{\\mathrm {X}}+U_{\\mathrm {LSP}}-i\\left(\\frac {\u03b3_{X}}{2}+\\frac {\u03b3_{\\mathrm {LSP}}}{2}\\right)\\right.$$\n\n$$\\left.\\pm \\sqrt {4g^{2}+\\left(U_{\\mathrm {X}}-U_{\\mathrm {LSP}}-i\\left(\\frac {\u03b3_{\\mathrm {X}}}{2}-\\frac {\u03b3_{\\mathrm {LSP}}}{2}\\right)\\right)^{2}}\\right]$$\n\n(3)\n\nTherefore, considering a nondispersive exciton and size-dispersive LSP, the signature of the coupled system shows a split of the dispersion relation corresponding with the upper and lower exciton polaritons. To observe Rabi splitting,the difference between the upper and lower energies of the polaritons, $\\left(4g^{2}-\\left(\\left(\u03b3_{\\mathrm {X}}/2\\right)-\\left(\u03b3_{\\mathrm {LSP}}/2\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right)^{1/2}$ should be larger than the polariton line width $\\left(\u03b3_{\\mathrm {X}}/2\\right)+\\left(\u03b3_{\\mathrm {LSP}}/2\\right)$ ,resulting in the following condition for strong coupling and Rabi splitting: $3,52,53$ \n\n$$\\hbar \u03a9_{\\mathrm {R}}=2g>\\sqrt {\\frac {\u03b3_{\\mathrm {X}}^{2}}{2}+\\frac {\u03b3_{\\mathrm {LSP}}^{2}}{2}}\\tag{4}$$\n\nIt is important to note that, even with coupling energies that do not fulfill the condition in eq 4, the interaction between the LSP and exciton modes can result in spectral splitting and asymmetric line shapes (e.g., Fano resonances), $52,54$  although these do not indicate Rabi energy transfer. This is an important point with respect to aluminum plasmonics, which can suffer from faster damping rates of the LSP modes compared to noble metals.\n\nThe interaction between LSPs and excitons can be studied either by using single nanoantennas32,34,35or by using arrays of subwavelength spaced nanoantennas.29 If the nanoparticle size is smaller than the separation distance between the closest neighbors, near field interparticle coupling can be neglected,55and the resonances in each array are determined by the LSP resonances of individual nanoparticles.\n\n**Experiment and Results.** The studied samples, as illustrated in Figure 1, consisted of subwavelength-spaced arrays of Al nanodisks and nanorods fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate and covered with a thin (~20 nm) layer of J-aggregating cyanine dye molecules (TDBC). All of the nanoantennas were 40 nm thick, and the area of each of the arrays was $15\\times 15$ \u03bc\u33a1. As illustrated in Figure 1a, each nanodisk array had a different disk diameter, $D$ ranging from 75 nm to 205 nm, and a fixed side to side\n\n<!-- **6216** -->\n\n<!-- DOI:10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b02584 -->\n\n<!-- Nano Lett. 2015,15,6215-6221 -->\n\n<!-- Nano Letters -->\n\n<!-- **Letter** -->\n\n<!-- (a) TDBC ITO Glass y -->\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/d285f44e73251b89.jpg)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/db2ad7f36b4a4e5d.jpg)\n\n<!-- 20\u03bcm $20\u03bcm$ -->\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/dfa3f1ded841f4c9.jpg)\n\n<!-- (d) (e) \u0443 TDBC ITO x Glass- (f) $\\frac{\\hat{x}}{\\hat{y}\\rceil}$ $20\u03bcm$ -->\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/28c6ec90e97ce60a.jpg)\n\nFigure 1.

Each nanorod array (Figure 1d),had a different rod length, $L,$  ranging from 75 nm to 205nm, with a fixed side to side separation in the $x$  direction, $\u0393_{}$ and in the $y$  direction, $\u0393_{y\\prime }$  (~200 nm and $\\;150$  nm, respectively). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of one of the bare nanodisk arrays $(D=140$ nm) is shown in Figure 1b, and an image of white light transmission through 12arrays with different nanodisk diameters is shown in Figure 1c. The vivid colors in the transmission image are due to size dependent resonant coupling of the light to the dipolar $LSPs$ of the nanodisks, which scatter and absorb the light at the LSP resonance. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of one of the nanorod arrays $(L=12$ 00 nm) is shown in Figure 1e, and an image of polarized white light transmission through the nanorod arrays is shown in Figure 1f. In this case, coupling to LSPs becomes polarization dependent. When the polarization is along the long axis, vivid colors are observed due to coupling to LSPs across the entire visible spectrum. When the polarization is rotated by $90^{\\circ }$ , the sample becomes transparent due to coupling to ultraviolet LSPs.\n\nWe used TDBC J-aggregates as the excitonic material because of their remarkable optical properties including delocalization of the exciton, narrow absorption and emission spectra, high binding energy, and large oscillator strengths (order of 10 D),56 which allow them to couple strongly to EM fields at room temperature. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of water-TDBC solution spin coated on ITO coated glass is shown in Figure 2a. The J-band absorption peak is at 2.1eV and has a line width of ~0.066 eV. The fluorescence exhibits slightly narrower line width and a very small Stokes shift of ~0.007 eV.\n\nThe coupling between the LSP modes on the nanoantennas and the excitons in the J-aggregates occurs in the overlap region of the J-aggregates andd the LSP modes. Figure 2b and c shows finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations of the LSP electric field enhancement in the $x-y$ plane for a nanodisk and a nanorod, respectively, which were tuned to support an LSP resonance at the same wavelength $(\u03bb=530$ nm).\n\n<!-- 5% (a) (ne) eouedosQY 5\u00b0 $10^{\\circ }$ (n,e)eOue0seonliu 500 600 700 800 Wavelength(nm) -->\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/da2a81b4fa93d420.jpg)\n\n<!-- $\\left|E/E_{0}\\right|$ 100 (b) 6 5 4 (Eu 0 3 2 100 1 100 0 100 $x(nm)$ -->\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/3661ce7214790f30.jpg)\n\n<!-- $\\left|E/E_{0}\\right|$ 8 50 (c) 6 \uff08\u65e5u\uff09 0 4 50 2 100 0 100 x(nm) -->\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/168ffd6a9b031803.jpg)\n\n**Figure** 2.

Here we find that aluminum plasmonic nanostructures provide an excellent platform for the generation of hybrid X-LSPs states. We measured a giant Rabi splitting of 0.4 eV, which is among the highest splitting energies reported in literature for a nano-particle-based plasmonic system. The splitting energy is ~20% of the uncoupled exciton transition energy and corresponds to an ultrafast energy transfer between the modes on a 10fs time scale. In addition we found that the X-LSP hybrid states can be polarized by geometrical means and that the physical parameter that limits the coupling strength is the ratio between the overlap volume $V_{\\mathrm {X}}$ and total mode volume V rather than just the mode volume. Finally, we were also able to observe the effects of X-LSPs on the emission. This is an important step toward unveiling the intriguing dynamics of strongly coupled X-LSP states in plasmonic systems for which there is less evidence than has been demonstrated in recent years for exciton-polaritons in optical microcavities. $5,6,16,59$  The emission measurements show enhancement correlated with the X-LSP energies due to improved resonant pumping and an increase of the density of states at the polariton energies. In light of the emerging technological applications based on strongly coupled light-matter states, the results reported in this Letter open new possibilities for using nanoscale, technologically compatible, integrated platforms based on Al, that can be adapted to work all over the visible region down to ultraviolet frequencies.\n\nMethods. An indium tin oxide-coated glass substrate was cleaned and then spin-coated with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), followed by baking at $180^{\\circ }C$  on a hot plate for 1min. The nanodisk and nanorod arrays were written bby an electron-beam lithography system (Raith 150) at 10 kV, followed by evaporating 40 nm of Al at 2 \u00c5/s. The resist was then lifted off using acetone. The samples were spin-coated with a solution of 2 g of deionized water mixed with 0.015 g of cyanine dye molecules (TDBC) at 3000 rpm and sonicated for 10 min. TDBC (5,6-dichloro-2-[[5,6-dichloro-1-ethyl-3-(4-suilfobutyl)-benzimidazol-2-ylidene]-propenyl]-1-ethyl-3-(4-sul-fobutyl)-benzimidazolium hydroxide, inner salt, sodium salt) was purchased from Few Chemicals. The dimensions of the nanodisks and nanorods were determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM JSM-6700).\n\nAll measurements were performed at room temperature. Spectral transmission measurements were performed using a Xenon arc lamp, Mitutoyo $50\\times /0.42$  objective and a fiber optic coupled spectrometer (Avantes AvaSpec-3648). The sample was placed on a nanopositioning stage (Thorlabs, NanoMax 606) which was controlled by a computer. Emission measure-ments were recorded using a Zeiss axio observer Z1m microscope in reflection mode. The excitation source was a tunable femtosecond laser (Chameleon OPO VIS, pulse width of 140 fs, repetition rate of 80 MHz). Emissions were collected by a spectrometer (Andor, Shamrock 303i) with a $100\\times /0.75$ objective.\n\nThree dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations were performed using Lumerical Solutions software. The simulations were periodic in the $x-y$ plane with $\u0393=180$ nm for the nanodisk arrays and with $\u0393_{y}=150$ nm and $\u0393_{x}=200$ nm for the nanorod arrays. The simulated structures comprised a glass substrate, modeled as a dielectric with refractive index of $n=1.51$ coated with a 30 nm layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) modeled using data from the Sopra Material Database. The 40 nm high nanodisks or nanorods on top of this substrate were modeled using Palik data for $\\text {Al.}{}^{60}$ The TDBC coating was modeled as a 20 nm layer of a single Lorentzian oscillator $\u03b5_{\\text {Lontz}(\u03c9)}=\u03b5_{\\infty }+\\left(\u03c9_{\\mathrm {X}}^{2}/\\left(\u03c9_{\\mathrm {X}}^{2}-\u03c9^{2}-\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.i\u03b3_{\\mathrm {X}}\u03c9\\right)\\right)$ ,where $\u03b5_{\\infty }=2.56$ comes from the bound electron permittivity, $\\omega _{\\mathrm {X}}=3.22\\times 10^{15}$  [rad/s] is the oscillator frequency, $\\gamma _{\\mathrm {X}}=2.45\\times 10^{13}$ [rad/s] is the damping constant, and $f=0.45$ is the oscillator strength. The shape of the nanorods was modeled as an ellipse with a constant minor axis length of 25 nm.\n\n\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/699ac6777753e614.jpg)\n\n## ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n\n# SSupporting Information\n\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.nano-lett.5b02584.\n\nS1: Nanorod array simulations, FDTD simulations of bare and covered nanorod arrays, calculations for exciton and LSP fractions of the upper or lower X-LSP polariton states of the nanorod arrays.
