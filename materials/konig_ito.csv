# DOI: 10.1021/am405100n
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=other&book=In2O3-SnO2&page=Konig
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: ITO is a transparent conducting oxide (TCO). Properties depend strongly
# on deposition conditions and doping level. This is typical sputtered ITO.
# Used for transparent electrodes, touchscreens, and electrochromic devices.
# Shows plasmonic behavior in near-IR due to free carriers.
