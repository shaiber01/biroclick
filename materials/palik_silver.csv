# Silver (Ag) optical constants
# Source: P.B. Johnson and R.W. Christy, Phys. Rev. B 6, 4370-4379 (1972)
# DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.6.4370
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=Ag&page=Johnson
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: Silver has the lowest optical losses among noble metals, making it
# ideal for high-quality-factor plasmonic resonances. Data valid for bulk silver.
# Thin films or nanoparticles may have different optical properties.
