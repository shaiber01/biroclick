# DOI: 10.1149/1.2403440
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=Si3N4&page=Philipp
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: Stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si3N4). Low-loss dielectric with n~2.0.
# Standard material for photonic waveguides and integrated photonics.
# LPCVD and PECVD films may have slightly different properties due to H content.
