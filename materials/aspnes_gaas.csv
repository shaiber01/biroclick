# Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) optical constants
# Source: D.E. Aspnes and A.A. Studna, Phys. Rev. B 27, 985-1009 (1983)
# DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.27.985
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=GaAs&page=Aspnes
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: GaAs is a direct bandgap III-V semiconductor (Eg=1.42 eV, ~870nm).
# High refractive index (n~3.5). Used for lasers, LEDs, solar cells, and
# quantum dot nanostructures. Strong absorption above bandgap.
