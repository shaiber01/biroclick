# Silicon (Si) optical constants from Palik Handbook
# Source: E.D. Palik, Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids (1998)
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=Si&page=Aspnes
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: Silicon is a high-index semiconductor (n~3.5 in visible/NIR).
# Strong absorption above bandgap (~1100nm, 1.12 eV).
# Below ~400nm, absorption becomes very strong.
