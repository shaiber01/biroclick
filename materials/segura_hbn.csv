# DOI: 10.1063/1.5046889
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=2d&book=hBN&page=Segura-o
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: In-plane (ordinary ray) optical constants. hBN is a layered material
# similar to graphite but insulating. Used for encapsulating graphene and other
# 2D materials. Supports phonon polaritons in mid-IR (Reststrahlen band).
# Strong UV absorption near 215nm exciton.
