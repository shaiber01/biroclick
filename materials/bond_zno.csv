# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=ZnO&page=Bond-o
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: Wurtzite ZnO, ordinary ray. Wide bandgap semiconductor (3.37 eV, ~368nm).
# Transparent conductor, piezoelectric, used in SAW devices and gas sensors.
# Can be doped (Al-doped AZO) for better conductivity.
