# DOI: 10.1364/JOSA.52.001377
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=Al2O3&page=Malitson-o
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: Crystalline sapphire (alpha-Al2O3), ordinary ray. Transparent dielectric.
# Common substrate material. Native oxide on aluminum (~2-3nm) may affect
# plasmonic resonances. Very hard, chemically resistant.
