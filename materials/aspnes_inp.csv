# DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.27.985
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=InP&page=Aspnes
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: III-V semiconductor, direct bandgap 1.34 eV (~925nm). Key material for
# telecom photonics (1550nm), lasers, and photonic integrated circuits.
# Substrate for InGaAsP devices. High refractive index (n~3.1-3.5).
