# Germanium (Ge) optical constants
# Source: D.E. Aspnes and A.A. Studna, Phys. Rev. B 27, 985-1009 (1983)
# DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.27.985
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=Ge&page=Aspnes
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: Germanium is a very high-index semiconductor (n~4-5). Indirect bandgap
# at 0.66 eV (~1880nm), direct gap at 0.8 eV (~1550nm). Strong absorption in
# visible, transparent in mid-IR. Used for IR optics and high-index resonators.
