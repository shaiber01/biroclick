# Titanium Dioxide (TiO2, Rutile) optical constants
# Source: J.R. Devore, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 41, 416-419 (1951)
# DOI: 10.1364/JOSA.41.000416
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=TiO2&page=Devore-o
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: TiO2 rutile, ordinary ray. High refractive index dielectric (n~2.4-2.9).
# Transparent in visible range (k~0). Common for photocatalysis, metasurfaces,
# anti-reflection coatings, and high-index dielectric nanoantennas.
# Anatase phase has slightly different optical constants.
