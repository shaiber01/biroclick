# Magnesium Fluoride (MgF2) optical constants
# Source: M.J. Dodge, Appl. Opt. 23, 1980-1985 (1984)
# DOI: 10.1364/AO.23.001980
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=MgF2&page=Dodge-o
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: Low-index material (n~1.38), ideal for anti-reflection coatings.
# Transparent from UV to mid-IR. Commonly used in optical thin films.
# Ordinary ray of uniaxial crystal.
