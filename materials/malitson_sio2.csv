# Silicon Dioxide (SiO2, fused silica) optical constants
# Source: I.H. Malitson, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 55, 1205-1209 (1965)
# DOI: 10.1364/JOSA.55.001205
# Data compiled from: https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=SiO2&page=Malitson
# Format: wavelength_nm, n (real part of refractive index), k (imaginary part)
#
# Note: SiO2 is transparent (k~0) throughout visible and NIR.
# This is fused silica; crystalline quartz has slightly different values.
# Commonly used as substrate material.
