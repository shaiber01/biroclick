# Test Paper Title: Optical Properties of Gold Nanoparticles

## Abstract

This is a sample markdown file for testing the paper loader functionality.
We study the optical properties of gold nanoparticles using FDTD simulations.

## Introduction

Gold nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) that
depend strongly on their size and shape.

## Methods

We used finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations with a mesh resolution
of 2 nm. The simulation domain was 400 nm × 400 nm × 400 nm with PML boundaries.

## Results

Figure 1 shows the extinction spectrum of a gold nanosphere with 50 nm diameter.

The near-field enhancement at the LSPR wavelength is shown in Figure 2.

## Discussion

The simulation results agree well with Mie theory predictions.

## Conclusions

Gold nanospheres show a characteristic LSPR around 520 nm wavelength.
